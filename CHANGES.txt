    compteurs... 16 bit... en milliemes.

unknown/WILL NOT DO:
  -- decimal in counters.
     will not match, because have to convert to decimals, and will not match
     integer counters. 


DONE:


2010/09/18:
  -- have toggle buttons visually confirm state.
  -- make protocol symmetrical
       -- rx register setting
       -- rx draw command.
  -- use poll & serial peek commands to remove non-blocking reads.
  -- starts up with no connection (need not have a bmf object working.)
  -- move logging to work with callbacks, so other classes can log.
  -- have protocol for drawing in the char window.
  -- have it work with sockets, and have two bmf's talk to eachother.
  -- get on github. need public ssh key for that.
  -- send multiple arbitrary bytes (>1)
  -- have Settings dialog work.


2010/09/10:
----------
  -- send arbitrary byte (dialog)
  -- one big fixed window.
  -- compteur x, y, z.   absolut et relative.
  -- 20x48 character display.

  compteurs:
    ax, ay, az       -  01, 02, 03
    relx, rely, relz -  04, 05, 06

  -- GUI exposure of writechk.
     (writechk just prints errors to stdout...)
     see status messages at bottom of app window.


2010/08/22:
  -- check return status of all record writes.
  -- another dialog to specify start address for bulk xfers.
  -- default command now is to start GUI.

  -- encode binary in intelhex binary format.
  -- transliterate .hex into binary format.
  -- sends them one a a time waiting for successful receipt. signal.
